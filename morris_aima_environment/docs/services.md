All Environments share some common services you may access. They are outlined below.
Any environment you wish to add, must support these as well.

morris_aima_environment/start
- Begin running the environment cycles, and doing state transitions.

morris_aima_environment/stop
- Stop running environment cycles. This will pause the environment in it's current state.

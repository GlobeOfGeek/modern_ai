# Morris AiMA
This is a porting of the Morris AIMA software to the ROS environment.

# What is this?
In short, Morris AIMA is an Artificial Intelligence framework/toolkit inspired by Russel and Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" textbook.
I began with the ambition to complete this textbook cover to cover, while implementing and providing each of the solutions.
As a result most demo-material for this software will be using the AIMA book as a support.

# Why?
In pursuit of graduate studies in Computer Science (with focus in Artificial Intelligence), I wanted to get involved in some sort of project that would let me explore the wide foundations of AI. Thus, this project is a curation of my undergraduate experience -- a digital timeline showing the improvements in my problem solving skills as I further my studies.

# Package Information
- **morris_aima_environment:** Handles the Environment (model) logic. The state space for a given problem is explored here.
- **morris_aima_msgs:** Messages and services used by the other packages in this project.
- **morris_aima_control:** Gathers results from environment/visualizer, provides interface to control both at once.
- **morris_aima_visualizer:** Visualize what's going on with the Environment using friendly colours and pics instead of scary numbers.

# Future Plans
Through opportunities provided to me via the University of Manitoba's Autonomous Agents Lab, I will be expanding this software to be a more general framework for Robotics/AI via the ROS system. I hope to use this to aid in my undergraduate research experience, while partaking in various robotics competitions such as HuroCup, RoboCup, and Robot Magic.

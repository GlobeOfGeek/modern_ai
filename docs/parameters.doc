When beginning a morris_aima program, the Environment, Simulator, and Visualizer will share some global parameters.

morris_aima_control/world_type: This specifies the name of the project/world that is being worked on. The Environment and Visualizer will take this and use it to determine what Topic to publish/listen on.
  Example: morris_aima_control/world_type = "vacuum_world"
  This will have the main Controller publish on morris_aima/vacuum_world
  The environment publish on morris_aima_environment/vacuum_world 
  The Visualizer will subscribe to messages from morris_aima/vacuum_world and will handle visualizing this type of message.
